# Welcome to innopolis.js - the open-source organization!

Here, as JS-ers of Innopolis, we publish our open-source projects to give them love and support they deserve (and a stable amount of contributors, too)!

It's a litle empty for now, as not many of us have something to offer, but we'll get there, no worries. ðŸ˜‰

For now, if you wanna show-off some awesome projects of yours here, feel free to participate in https://github.com/innopolis-js/welcome/discussions/2, we'll gladly add you to the org!

Before commenting someting or contributing, be sure to check out our [**code of conduct**](https://github.com/innopolis-js/welcome/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [**contributing guidelines**](https://github.com/innopolis-js/welcome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
